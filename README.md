## Stats

### Stars by year

Before 2025, each year had 25 days; now each year has 12. Each day per year has
two parts, each awarding one star for the correct answer. You can't access part
two without completing part one. Before 2025 the maximum stars per year was 50;
now it's 24.

| Year           | Stars |
| -------------- | ----- |
| 2025 (ongoing) | 4     |
| 2024           | 40    |
| 2023           | 10    |
| 2022           | 2     |
| 2015           | 4     |

### Parts solved by language by year

Solving parts in multiple languages doesn't award extra stars, but it's a fun
way to learn/practice different languages.

| Language   | 2025 (ongoing) | 2024 | 2023 | 2022 | 2015 | Total  |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ |
| TypeScript | 0              | 40   | 10   | 0    | 4    | **54** |
| C#         | 0              | 8    | 0    | 0    | 0    | **8**  |
| Ruby       | 4              | 0    | 0    | 2    | 0    | **6**  |
| Go         | 0              | 4    | 0    | 0    | 0    | **4**  |
| Rust       | 0              | 4    | 0    | 0    | 0    | **4**  |
