# 2024 TypeScript

## Installation

Install Bun if necessary, then run `bun install` from the
`2024/solutions/typescript` directory

## Creating an app/script for a new day

In the day's directory within `2024/solutions/typescript`, create `solution.ts`
and `solution.test.ts` files. This could be automated along the lines of what
was done in `2023/script/generateDay.ts`

## Getting the answers

From the repo root, run `bun run
2024/solutions/typescript/ZERO_PADDED_DAY/solution.ts`

## Running the tests

From the repo root, run `bun test 2024/solutions/typescript/ZERO_PADDED_DAY`

## Running the scripts or tests from the day folder

The scripts or tests could also be run from their directory if you specify the
location of the `.env` file:
