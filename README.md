## Stats

### Stars by year

Each of the 25 days per year has two parts. Finding the correct answer for part
one awards one star and reveals part two. Finding the correct answer for part
two awards a second star, meaning that there are a maximum of 50 stars available
each year

| Year           | Stars |
| -------------- | ----- |
| 2024 (ongoing) | 38    |
| 2023           | 10    |
| 2022           | 2     |
| 2015           | 4     |

### Parts solved by language by year

Starting in 2024, I've solved some parts in multiple languages. This doesn't
award extra stars
